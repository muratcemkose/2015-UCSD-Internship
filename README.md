** The scripts in this folder are desiged for analysis of spesific reasearch questions for spesific datasets.

 - Normalized RNA-seq Data Analysis For Breast Cancer Research = A Tepmlate script for differential gene expression alaysis for normalized TCGA RNa-seq data. The script is used for breast
cancer subtypes. It includes features such as students t-test, outlier elemination by PCA, heatmapping, clustering, survival and cox-hazard regression.

 - Microarray Data Trim = The script is used for data manipualion of Microarray data after normalization done by R.

 - RNA binding proteins CNV analysis = A script written for helping Proffessor Carter for her CNV analysis collaboration project. 

 - Various Types of Microarray Data Analysis For Gastrointertinal Cancer Research = 1 and 2 dyed Microarray data from different platforms are merged and analysed for Gastrointestinal Cancer.
The project cancelled due to too much variation among datasets.

 - Database Merge For Target Pathway Search = Database informations are imported form various databases and merged into one file. All those information are used to search a target patway 
for our genes of interests. The found pathways are visualized by using Cytoscape and NetworkX.
